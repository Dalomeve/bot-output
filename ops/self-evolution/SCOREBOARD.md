# Scoreboard

| Date | Task | Attempt | Pass | Evidence | Failure Mode | Reusable Rule |
|------|------|---------|------|----------|--------------|---------------|
| 2026-03-01 | A | 1 | pass | [task-a-attempt1.md](https://github.com/Dalomeve/bot-output/blob/main/outputs/2026-03-01-self-evolution/task-a-attempt1.md) | N/A | Always verify file existence with explicit directory listing before claiming artifact creation. |
| 2026-03-01 | A | 2 | pass | [task-a-attempt2.md](https://github.com/Dalomeve/bot-output/blob/main/outputs/2026-03-01-self-evolution/task-a-attempt2.md) | N/A | Incorporate explicit verification command output in artifact files. |
| 2026-03-01 | B | 1 | pass | [task-b-attempt1.md](https://github.com/Dalomeve/bot-output/blob/main/outputs/2026-03-01-self-evolution/task-b-attempt1.md) | PowerShell argument splitting | Always use native PowerShell cmdlets with explicit parameter names on Windows; avoid bash-style flags like `-s`, `-la`, `-rf`. |
| 2026-03-01 | C | 1 | pass | [verification.md](https://github.com/Dalomeve/bot-output/blob/main/outputs/2026-03-01-xtrending/report/verification.md) | N/A | Incremental updates must include fresh verification evidence (timestamps, status codes, content excerpts) not just cosmetic changes. |
| 2026-03-02 | Daily Evidence Audit | 1 | ✅ pass | [evidence-audit.md](https://github.com/Dalomeve/bot-output/blob/main/outputs/2026-03-01-qa/evidence-audit.md) | N/A | Auditor script validates external link format, internal link resolution (with bot-output/ fallback), and excludes documentation references to markers in backticks. |
| 2026-03-02 | Daily Self-Heal Loop | 1 | ✅ pass | [self-heal-2026-03-02.md](https://github.com/Dalomeve/bot-output/blob/main/outputs/2026-03-02-self-evolution/self-heal-2026-03-02.md) | auth_or_config + network_or_reachability | When crypto market data sources are needed, check for: (1) Brave API key for web_search, (2) browser tool with Chrome profile for JS-heavy sites, (3) fallback to manual user verification with specific URLs. |
