# Daily Self-Heal Loop - 2026-03-02 08:15

## Reflexion-Style Review

### Failure Pattern Extracted
- **Pattern**: Auth/config missing causing task blockages (API keys, Cloudflare-protected sites)
- **Signature**: `web_search requires BRAVE_API_KEY; web_fetch blocked by Cloudflare (403)`
- **Class**: `auth_or_config` + `network_or_reachability`
- **Occurrences**: 2+ (blocked-items.md shows recurring pattern)

### Reusable Rule
When crypto market data sources are needed, check for:
1. Brave API key for web_search tool
2. Browser tool with Chrome profile for JS-heavy/Cloudflare-protected sites
3. Fallback to manual user verification with specific URLs

## Concrete Fix Attempt

### Target: Solana Meme Coin Search (Blocked Item 2)

| Attempt | Action | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | web_fetch gmgn.ai/solana | 403 Cloudflare block |
| 2 | web_fetch dexscreener.com/solana | 403 Cloudflare block |
| 3 | browser open gmgn.ai | Tab not accessible (no Chrome profile attached) |

### Final Status: BLOCKED (requires user config action)

### Minimum Unblock Input
User to run one of:
- `openclaw configure --section web` (store Brave API key for web_search)
- Attach Chrome browser profile via OpenClaw Browser Relay toolbar icon (for JS-heavy sites)

### Fallback Path
Manual user verification at:
- https://gmgn.ai/solana
- https://dexscreener.com/solana

## Artifacts Updated

1. `memory/blocked-items.md` - Added attempt details and workaround paths
2. `memory/2026-03-02.md` - Added self-heal lesson entry
3. `skills/local/memory-self-heal/SKILL.md` - Added crypto data source pattern to known fixes
4. `bot-output/skills/memory-self-heal/SKILL.md` - Mirrored skill update
5. `bot-output/ops/self-evolution/SCOREBOARD.md` - Added self-heal row

## Verification Checklist

- [x] memory/blocked-items.md updated with attempt evidence
- [x] memory/2026-03-02.md contains self-heal lesson
- [x] skills/local/memory-self-heal/SKILL.md updated with new pattern
- [x] bot-output/skills/memory-self-heal/SKILL.md mirrored
- [x] SCOREBOARD.md updated with new row
- [x] No unresolved PENDING/TODO/TBD markers in artifacts

## Next Autonomous Step
- Monitor for user config action (Brave API key or Chrome profile attach)
- If config updated, retry Solana meme coin search with web_search or browser tool
