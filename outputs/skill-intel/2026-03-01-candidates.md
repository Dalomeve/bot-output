# OpenClaw Skill Intel: Recurring User Pain Points

**Date:** 2026-03-01  
**Source:** GitHub Issues (openclaw/openclaw)  
**Total Candidates:** 12

## Candidate Pain Points Table

| # | Title | URL | Pain Summary | Why Recurring (Signals) | Estimated Impact | Risk |
|---|-------|-----|--------------|------------------------|------------------|------|
| 1 | Discord: attachments silently fail to attach / no response triggered | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30741 | PDF and file attachments in Discord are intermittently dropped without error or user notification. Users have no way to know if attachment was processed. | 1) Multiple PDFs in same session show inconsistent behavior (some work, some fail). 2) Issue describes intermittent/condition-dependent pattern suggesting systemic problem. | High - Silent failures prevent users from completing document analysis workflows. | Low - Data loss concern, no security risk. |
| 2 | Subagent spawn fails with pairing required when gateway TLS is enabled (Docker) | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30740 | When TLS is enabled in Docker deployments, spawned sub-agents cannot connect to gateway (pairing required error). No workaround exists without breaking external access. | 1) Affects all Docker deployments with TLS (common production setup). 2) Security check blocks ws:// to non-loopback, but wss:// requires pairing - catch-22. | High - Blocks multi-agent workflows in containerized environments. | Medium - Security vs usability tradeoff. |
| 3 | [telegram] Typing indicator stuck when agent returns null/undefined reply | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30731 | When agent returns null/undefined instead of empty string, Telegram typing indicator stays active for 2-minute TTL. Poor UX, appears bot is frozen. | 1) Root cause identified in code (guard only handles empty strings). 2) Affects any tool-only run or early-return scenario. | Medium - UX degradation, user confusion. | Low - Cosmetic issue, self-resolving after TTL. |
| 4 | Edit tool returns misleading 'File not found' for paths outside workspace sandbox | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30724 | Edit tool gives misleading error for valid paths outside workspace. Read works on same path, Edit fails. Inconsistent tool behavior confuses users. | 1) Affects multi-agent setups where orchestrator needs to edit other agent workspace files. 2) Workaround requires exec with cat > (shell escape). | Medium - Wasted debugging time, inconsistent API. | Low - Security boundary working as intended, poor error message. |
| 5 | Session I/O tools lost in Telegram DM after tool errors — Tool not found while gateway healthy | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30723 | After a tool error (e.g., web_fetch aborted), all subsequent tool calls fail with "Tool not found" in same session. Gateway is healthy, /reset required. | 1) 100% reproducible pattern described. 2) Multiple tool calls fail after single error - session corruption. | High - Session becomes unusable, requires restart. | Medium - Data loss if session state not saved. |
| 6 | 跨渠道消息不同步 - 跨渠道消息不同步 - 网页版与飞书聊天记录不互通 | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30714 | Messages in webchat and Feishu (Lark) are stored separately. Users cannot view conversation history across channels, breaking continuity. | 1) Feature request for cross-channel sync (common user expectation). 2) Multiple channels mentioned (webchat, feishu) - affects all multi-channel users. | Medium - Fragmented user experience, context loss. | Low - Architectural decision, not a bug. |
| 7 | Bug: memory index command stuck in infinite loop | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30713 | `openclaw memory index` never completes, shows 0% CPU, repeats "batch start" indefinitely. Memory search becomes unavailable. | 1) Affects all users with memory files (13 files mentioned). 2) Only way to stop is kill - no recovery. | High - Memory functionality completely broken. | Low - Command-line tool, doesn't affect runtime. |
| 8 | Sandbox exec: workdir path not mapped + stdout lost on background transition | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30711 | Two issues: (1) workdir parameter doesn't map host↔container paths correctly. (2) stdout dropped when process exceeds yieldMs and backgrounds. | 1) Affects all sandbox mode users with long-running commands. 2) Workaround requires shell wrapper (2>&1, cd handling). | High - Breaks script execution in sandbox mode. | Low - Workaround exists, affects advanced users. |
| 9 | Internal tool-call trace leaked into user-visible chat message (Olvid group) | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30704 | Internal debug text (e.g., "NO_REPLY +#+#+#+#+#+assistant to=functions.olvid_list_groups...") leaked to users in group chat. | 1) Concurrency issue with NO_REPLY + tool calls. 2) Internal implementation details exposed to end users. | Medium - Professional image, user confusion. | Medium - Information leakage (internal architecture). |
| 10 | Announce delivery: NO_REPLY token leaked as literal Telegram message | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30692 | Cron job announce delivery sends "NO_REPLY" as visible message after reminder text. Free-tier models output summary\n\nNO_REPLY pattern. | 1) Affects all cron jobs with announce delivery. 2) isSilentReplyText() only matches exact NO_REPLY, not trailing. | Medium - Confusing UX, unprofessional appearance. | Low - Cosmetic, no data exposure. |
| 11 | Telegram channel stops sending messages after receiving an image | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30674 | After receiving an image, Telegram channel stops sending outbound messages. Inbound still works. Gateway restart only temporarily fixes. | 1) Reliably triggered by image reception. 2) Extensive troubleshooting ruled out network/config - internal bug. | High - Channel becomes one-way, requires workarounds. | Low - No data loss, recoverable with /start. |
| 12 | bug(matrix): messages sent during gateway restart are silently dropped | https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/30670 | Matrix messages with server timestamp before exact startup moment are discarded. startupGraceMs=0 means even messages sent milliseconds before restart are lost. | 1) Affects all Matrix users during any restart. 2) Busy rooms or crash-restart cycles lose user messages. | Medium - Message loss during maintenance windows. | Low - Expected behavior with poor default (0ms grace). |

## Notes

- All candidates sourced from public GitHub issues (openclaw/openclaw repository).
- Recurring signals verified through issue descriptions mentioning patterns, multiple occurrences, or systemic causes.
- Low-value/one-off noise rejected: Issues with "No response" in impact/severity fields and minimal detail (e.g., #30730 Soul.md problem) were excluded.
- Candidates selected for: clear pain description, evidence of recurrence, actionable skill opportunities.
