## Scoring Notes

### Top 3 Justification

**#1 Rank - Issue 5 (Session I/O Corruption)**
- Frequency 9: 100% reproducible pattern, affects all sessions after any tool error
- Impact 9: Session becomes completely unusable, requires restart
- Feasibility 8: Skill can auto-detect tool failures and trigger recovery
- Safety 7: Auto-restart is safe, preserves session state
- Reusability 9: Applies to all channels and session types

**#2 Rank - Issue 1 (Discord Attachment Failures)**
- Frequency 7: Intermittent but common in document-heavy workflows
- Impact 8: Silent data loss prevents task completion
- Feasibility 9: Skill can verify attachment success and retry
- Safety 9: No risk in verification/retry logic
- Reusability 8: Applies to all file types and Discord contexts

**#3 Rank - Issue 11 (Telegram Send Block After Image)**
- Frequency 6: Reliably triggered by image reception
- Impact 9: Channel becomes one-way, breaks workflows
- Feasibility 7: Skill can detect send failures and restart channel
- Safety 8: Channel restart is safe operation
- Reusability 7: Telegram-specific but high-value

### Score Calculation Formula

```
Total = (Frequency x 0.30) + (Impact x 0.25) + (Feasibility x 0.20) + (Safety x 0.15) + (Reusability x 0.10)
```

All scores on 0-10 scale. Weighted components shown in parentheses.
