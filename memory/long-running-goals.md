## 1. Agent Audit Trail - Continuous Expansion

**Started**: 2026-03-01
**Status**: Active (No endpoint)
**Repository**: https://github.com/Dalomeve/agent-audit-trail

### Mission

Continuously expand `agent-audit-trail` to become the standard verifiable execution tracker for AI agent workflows.

### Daily Requirements

| # | Requirement | Verification |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | At least one verifiable improvement daily | Code OR test OR doc OR integration |
| 2 | Every change must have evidence | Commit hash + verification command result |
| 3 | If no code changes: submit high-quality research/analysis | Document with next steps |
| 4 | Strict privacy: no real tokens/keys/personal data | Privacy scan before commit |
| 5 | No version endpoints (continuous mode) | No vX.Y.0 tags as completion |

### Improvement Categories

- **Code**: New features, bug fixes, performance improvements
- **Tests**: New test cases, coverage improvements, CI workflows
- **Docs**: README updates, examples, tutorials, API docs
- **Integration**: Hooks with other tools, plugins, adapters

### Verification Format

Each daily entry must include:
```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD

**Changes**: Description of improvement
**Category**: Code/Test/Doc/Integration
**Commit**: `<hash>`
**Verification**: Command + output
**Next**: Tomorrow's planned work
```

### Privacy Rules

- [ ] No API keys in code or examples
- [ ] No tokens in test files
- [ ] No personal emails/phones
- [ ] No internal service URLs
- [ ] Use placeholder values (REDACTED, example.com)

### Heartbeat Integration

Check this goal in every heartbeat:
1. Has there been a commit today?
2. If no: what's blocking?
3. If yes: verify evidence is complete
4. Queue next improvement

### Success Metrics (Long-Term)

- Daily streak maintained
- Weekly improvement summary
- Monthly usage/adoption review
- Quarterly feature roadmap (not versioned)
